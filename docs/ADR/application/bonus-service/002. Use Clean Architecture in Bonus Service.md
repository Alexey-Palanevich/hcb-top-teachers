## Context

In the current state of Software Engineering any business wants to have affordable, simple, fast, flexible, and reliable software.
Developers have to follow trends, using typical solutions, cutting angles, and making feature ASAP.
There's not time for experiments.

But if you want to make reliable solution, you need to know the ideal and non-working options.
So you have to find out it in working or pet projects.

As I see now it's a question of architecture.
Architectures try to make a system that:
1. Understandable (Simple)
2. Adaptive
3. Reliable

There're many architecture:
- [Hexagonal](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture)
- [Onion](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)
- [Screaming](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html)
- [DCI](https://dci.github.io/)
- [BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93control%E2%80%93boundary)
- [The Clean](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
- and many-many other.

Some frameworks (e.g. [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps), [Angular](https://angular.dev/essentials)) provide their own architecture too.

In current plans the project will have 3 services, I can check three possible architectures.
I've worked Clean Architecture and NestJS basic setup in depth.
I don't know other architecture much.

## Decision

It's a study project, so I may allow to experiment with different architectures and styles.
But it can delay whole project in general, I should start with something familiar.

Use Clean Architecture to split technical, application, and business layers of the bonus service.
Make the bonus service independent from transport, frameworks, view, database, and rest technologies.

Collecting insights and lessons learned after implementing service's use cases [TopTeachers.md#](../../../TopTeachers.md#us-110).

## Consequences

The bonus service will have more complex structure than usual CRUD service.
Adhering to Clean Architecture requires discipline in layering and dependency management.
Other developers may have troubles with learning curve.
There may be a problem with applying Clean Architecture on NestJS.

## Compliance

Use linter to check dependency injections.
Check architecture in PRs
