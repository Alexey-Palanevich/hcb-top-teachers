## Context

In the current state of Software Engineering we have to be fast, flexible, and adaptive.
People must dive in project easily.

Architectures try to make a system that:
1. Understandable
2. Adaptive
3. Reliable

There're many architecture:
- [Hexagonal](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture)
- [Onion](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)
- [Screaming](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html)
- [DCI](https://dci.github.io/)
- [BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93control%E2%80%93boundary)
- [The Clean](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
- and many many other

[NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps) as a framework also provides its architecture.

## Decision

Use The Clean Architecture to unify technical parts of services and highlight business and application cores.
Become independence from transport, frameworks, views, databases, and rest technologies.
Make common technical layers for each service and uniq clear business\application cores.

## Consequences

All services will have the same structure. It should allow developers to work with an unknown service
without spending a lot of time familiarizing themselves with it.

## Compliance

Use linter to check dependency injections.
Check architecture in PRs
