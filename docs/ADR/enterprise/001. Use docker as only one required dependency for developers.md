## Context

There's a painful issue with running projects in the same environment on different OS, with different tools.

Today,
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) has v20 as `Maintenance LTS`, v22 as `Active LTS`, and v24 as `Current` releases;

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/) has v17 as Main and v18 as Beta releases;
etc.

Developers usually use containerization tools to setup an infrastructure for a project.
This standardizes the environment in which the project operates.

Docker, k8s, Azure container Apps, Amazon Elastic Container Service, Nomad, Apache Mesos, etc.
All of them are used to standardize infrastructure. 

## Decision

In that project, we move on and standardize services too.
With services containerization we don't need to care about NodeJS and its version,
how to allow services to communicate with each other, and 
bring local development and production closer together.

I know well only Docker, so we use Docker.
The project may need k8s, but let's think about this in future.

## Consequences

Containers will be more complex than the common one. 
Developers will need more time to understand how everything works.

Developers will need only installed Docker to run the project.
Local and production versions will almost the same.

## Compliance

I have no idea how to automize it for now. So we check it in regular PRs.
