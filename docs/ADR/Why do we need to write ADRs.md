ADR is Architecture Decision Record.

ADR describes how decisions about system changes were made.
It is good because it preserves the context of the decision-making process,
even if there were hidden conditions, no suitable technologies were available, 
or the author was unaware of the existence of another solution.

Without such a document, it is difficult to develop the system because 
each new employee will spend a lot of time searching for answers or reworking the system
without taking into account hidden conditions.

| **Title**        | Short description of ADR with increment numeration. Numeration is required for understanding decisions order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Status**       | 1. *Proposed.* Waiting for approval by the techleader or architecture committee.<br><br>2. *Accepted.* Accepted and going to implementation.<br><br>3. *Rejected.* Rejected with required "Reason" section. In reason describe why decision isn't suitable for the project.<br><br>4. *Superseded.* Replaced with a new ADR. Required link to the new ADR. |
| **Context**      | The main section of the record, which describes the context of the current system. The place where business problems should be indicated, how they arise and connect with system condition. Alternative solutions are also indicated here, additional analysis may be provided in Alternatives section.                                                    |
| **Decision**     | Description of the solution and its rationale. Focus on **"why"** instead of **"how"** and describe the reasons why the decision made rather than describing how the solutions works.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Consequences** | Description of the impact of the decision on the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
